        ,
A gorgeous F-250 for sale.  Low miles, new water pump, new power steering pump, cap, rotor, sparkplug wires and plugs.  Automatic transmission, 5.8L V8.  Runs like a champ; after it's been warmed up.  Comes with another set of tires and stops between gas stations is minimized due to the factory installed dual tanks.  Complete with faded paint and cow dent character.  It's in decent shape.  The drivers side arm rest has finally given way.  It has been a great truck.  I bought it a few years ago to move with.  I haven't driven it in over a year, so it's time for spring cleaning.  ,
,
What's wrong with it?,
,
It needs a passenger side valve cover gasket.  It leaks some oil from it and drips down on to the exhaust manifold.  I've thought about fixing it, but found it easier and quicker to just check the oil and roll down the window before I drove. ,
,
It starts right up and sounds good.   But I have to let it warm up a while before I can put it in gear and go.  I'm sure its something simple, but I don't have the time to figure it out.,
,
Brakes are something I would do this spring anyway.  I've never done anything with them and have towed a trailer several times over the pass.  Last time I drove it, I was thinking I should probably do them soon. ,

If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			Many customers actually take delivery 			
			,			
			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			,			
			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			This is another very common situation that usually 			
			,			
			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,
						
			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.		,	,

			Yes. We have very simple process for this very common situation. Just give us a call.		,	,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			Many customers actually take delivery 			
			,			
			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			,			
			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			This is another very common situation that usually 			
			,			
			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,
						
			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.		,	,
						
,	,	,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			Many customers actually take delivery 			
			,			
			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			,			
			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			This is another very common situation that usually 			
			,			
			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,
						
			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.		,	,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,

			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.		,	,

If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,

Selling my 2021 2500 Chevrolet z71 sport edition pick up truck.  ,

This was purchased new by me in July of 2021.  Has 10,000 miles on it and will increase as I drive it to work.,

Selling because I need a 3500 dually. No other reason. Truck is 100% with no issues and full factory warranty. ,
,
Firm on my price as this is my payoff amount.  For an extra amount I can transfer my extended warranty that will give you coverage to 100,000 miles. ,

If you’ve been looking…this truck does not exist at dealerships right now.  As pictured everything is stock.  This was a special Sport Edition Z71 long box with a black out package and painted bumpers. ,

Long list of factory options but include thinks like lane departure, heads up display, birds eye camera view, heated and cooling seats, Bose sound system, remote start, collision warning, hill assist, automatic rear tailgate, wireless phone charging and wireless car play. ,

So I'll start with the bad.,
,
It is a missing lug on the front left and the tires could be better and then Clean it!!,
,
,
,
The drivers window needs the regulator installed and the new part in ready to be installed.   For those that don't know that means some time working on the install for that window assembly .,
,
  The new part comes with the deal.,
,
  It Didn't have a muffler when I bought it and still doesn't  however it's  not loud at all. ,
,
 It        ""needed""     brakes on the front end to avoid disaster :-)   That work is done?!!,
,
They have maybe 500 miles on them with absolutely no problem.,
,
Stereo works but the speaker that's in the driver side door isn't a fit. AC was overhauled mid summer for a boat trip to the Gorge for a 3 day run and it towed fabulously.,
,
The toe was for a 22 foot runabout ski boat heavily loaded for fun and it went perfect coming and going from Snoqualmie to Quincy and back and the trailer lights functioned perfectly.,
,
 This is in Snoqualmie and the location for the paperwork is in the Safeway parking lot in North bend the ladies are fabulous at expediting and helping!,
,
If I find any time I'll keep cleaning and the like but that's not likely.

Backed into a pole very slowly with the door open so it needs some body work, mostly on the driver side front. Door was fixed and works fine. One of the heater dials fell into the dash, still works but needs to be retrieved probably needs new clips. Few other small cosmetic issues, but nothing wrong mechanically.,
,
Selling for $4,200, will consider all trades and offers. ,

Definitely a good price for someone willing to put a couple bucks into it!,

Bluebook value in ""good"" condition is $5,200. (No mechanical defects with repairable cosmetic damage.)

2005 Cadillac CTS V OBO,"$16,500",Kirkland eastside ,https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/cto/d/kirkland-2005-cadillac-cts-obo/7446628962.html,"
        ,
Brand new remanufactured engine, comes with 3 year/100k warranty. The warranty is transferable and covers parts and labor for another engine if needed, no questions asked. The original 5.7L LS6 engine was sent down to Texas to be remanufactured from the block out. You can take the car into any shop in the area that works with the engine maker (jasper engines) to get any kind of engine maintenance done including a new engine for free. I worked with ""Eastside Automotive"" on 85th st in kirkland for the engine install, I'd recommend bringing it to them if any issues arise since they are familiar. I replaced the engine with the sole intent of selling the vehicle. I've put about 100 miles on the car since the engine was installed. It is ridiculously fast, super fun to drive. This engine work cost 12,000$.,
The car also has a brand new upgraded LS7 clutch with less than 1000 miles on it. The clutch is about 70lbs lighter than the stock clutch, it performs great. I got the clutch installed at the Bellevue cadillac dealership. The new clutch with a couple extra items was about 4,000$.,
Got a new starter about 1500 miles ago. Installed by Bellevue cadillac. New starter was about 1600$ with an engine tune up. ,
Rear seals on the differential replaced about 1200 miles ago.,
I've got all the receipts and warranty info for the above work. I also have 20,000$ of service records from the previous owner (2008-2020), all work done by Bellevue Cadillac. ,
I'm the third owner of this vehicle.,
This vehicle runs like it has 0 miles on it. ,
I'm selling this vehicle because I'd like to purchase a home soon. ,
,
Pros:,
New engine w/ warranty,
New upgraded clutch,
Interior in good condition,
New starter,
New rear differential seals,
Exterior in good condition,
5% tint on all windows except windshield (limo tint),
400hp,
Bose sound system sounds great,
Every function of this vehicle is in working order,
,
Cons:,
Could use a new windshield,

        ,
Vehicle: Dodge Ram 1500 Sport single cab and short bed 4x4,
,
Information:,
I bought this truck two years and 2000 miles ago to use as a dump run/ second car. When I got the truck it had recently had the brakes done on all four corners, as well as an oil change and transmission flush. Everything works as it should. I can’t think of anything that doesn’t work correctly…. All of the lights work (as far as I know), radio works, door locks, electric windows (the passenger window does roll-up slower than the driver window).,
,
I have the clean title in hand. The title is not rebuilt.,
,
After buying the truck I completed the following maintenance to make sure that it would be reliable and ready to go (I do this for all my cars).,
Serpentine belt + tensioner + idler,
Battery,
Cap and rotor,
Spark plugs,
Spark plug wires,
Air filter,
All of the above parts have about 2000 miles on them.,
,
The truck has the original window sticker and is the Sport Laramie edition which came with the color matching bumpers + fog lights.,
,
The tires are in decent shape and have somewhere between 50-60% tread left on them. ,
,
The hood and roof’s clear coats are peeling. The rest of the trucks clear coat is fine.,
,
The bed has a spray-in bedliner and tool box.,

Our dealership, Jdmoffroad, is located in Everett Washington(state) were just a few clicks North of Seattle. We focus our efforts on diesel 4x4 vehicles. Check out our website jdmoffroad.com to see additional inventory. Sales tax applicable for WA state residents.,
,
Year: 1991,
Make: Toyota,
Model: HiAce,
Mileage: 24,600mi,
Engine:  3L engine 2.8liter 4WD,
Transmission: AT,
,
The team at JDM OFFROAD is happy to offer this 91 Super Custom Limited Toyota HiAce.  Full of features, amazing interior, pearlescent paint, this Hiace has been given a lot of love and is ready for some serious road trips and daily driving.  ,
,
Odometer reads 39k kilometers, only 25,000 certified miles.,
Features a retro style digi dash, power retracting Rear view mirrors with directional cab controls. ,
Working Heat and AC ,
Drivers preset adjusts seat and steering wheel positions improving entry and exit.,
Automatic transmission with High Low transfer case.,
Part Time 4wd with Manual hubs, push button 4wd,
,
The interior is near immaculate— with factory plastic wrap still covering the much of the trim.,
Upholstery is velvety smooth to the touch.,
Storage compartments all around passenger cab. ,
Unique rail lights on ceiling. ,
“Super moon roof” trim level = 4 skylights ,
Joyful Talk: a microphone can be found on the ceiling above the back row of passenger seats and above the driver. When the driver turns on joyful talk, passengers and driver can easily communicate with the stereo speaker system. ,
Two layers of curtains on all windows behind the front cab, it also features a divider curtain to separate the front cab and passenger seating, making this HiAce one of the best vans in terms of stock privacy design. ,
As with many of the HiAces this one too has the ability to fold both rows of back seats down into a bed. The frontal row will also 180 spin so you can have meetings in the back. My only strife with the HiAce interior design is the size of the front cab cupholder— they are criminally small. This of course is no obstacle for enjoying the vehicle, since there are many types of aftermarket cupholder installations available. ,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,

Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,

			If youre seeing this ad, it is likely that the vehicle IS for sale within the Autonation network. Our intent is to prevent you from showing up after the vehicle has been moved.  Give us a call, let us physically touch it and confirm its availability. Well provide the local dealership name and address so that you dont waste your time.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			If the post still has a phone number, we almost certainly still have the vehicle at one of your local Autonation dealerships. Simply dial the number above and we'll be happy to point you to the correct store. We may even bring the vehicle to a store near you.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			No. We are not a buy here - pay here lot. However, because we are the largest retailer of New and Used vehicles in the U.S. we have access to banks and credit unions that can be a tremendous benefit to extremely challenged credit.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			Many customers actually take delivery 			
			,			
			 While this isn't a possibility in every situation, it is often an option when transacting with an Autonation dealership.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			,			
			 We need to buy cars from customers every day because of the huge demand in the used vehicle market. It isn't necessary for you to buy a vehicle either.  We'd love to purchase your vehicle regardless of age or mileage in most cases.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			This is another very common situation that usually 			
			,			
			prevent you from trading your vehicle and taking delivery of your next New or PreOwned vehicle.		,	,
						
,	,	,
						
			We've found that every single customer wants our bottom-line best price up front. Imagine going to a dealership and telling them ""don't tell me your best price, instead, keep going back and forth to your manager and waste as much of my time as possible, until we finally find your best price, and then try to guilt me into buying because you spent so much time with me"". If that's actually what you want, you may need help.		,	,
						
			We put our bottom line lowest price on every pre-owned vehicle and then let you decide if, and when you want to buy it. No pressure.		,	,

			COPY AND PASTE the link and in this ad, and find the CONTACT US tab on the right side of the Showroom Page.  Just ask ""Where might I see this vehicle?"". Someone will respond promptly.		,	,

This has been a great truck and drives extremely smooth.  I have all of the available maintenance/repair records since 2012.  There were no major repairs besides expected belt/spark plugs every few years.  A few years ago I upgraded the wheels to the matte black Fuel off-road wheels as well as new tires recently (Micheline LTX A/T 2; with less than 15K miles on them. They have a 60K warranty through Costco). I also recently added the Tonneau truck bed cover, which is a great amenity, especially to keep the rain out in the PNW! I added auto-start to the vehicle which is also a great feature for cold rainy days and even those snow days! I was one of the only folks on the road driving comfortably in the recent snow! You’ve got to love the 4WD.  I am the second owner (only 2 owners total) but this truck has been well maintained throughout its existence.,
,
I am deciding to sell this truck since my wife recently bought a new vehicle for our family, a Subaru ascent. We now have 3 vehicles and we want to reduce our car inventory so we can fit all vehicles in our driveway/garage.  It rides much better than my wife’s new car to be honest! It's not easy for me to let this great truck go! I hope that we can find a prospective owner that will take great care of it.,

2006 Toyota Tacoma PreRunner (2wd) Access Cab. 1 adult owner. Clean title in hand. 216k miles. V6 automatic. This is the TRD Offroad Package as well (but truck has been de-badged). ,
,
Truck has been used as a truck - so there are a few dings and scratches around the body but she still cleans up well for a black vehicle.,
Great truck but she has been replaced with a full size (4 doors and towing) and its time to let her go.,
,
Aftermarket goodies - 30% tint on doors and back. Alpine 4 channel amp and speakers professionally installed. Kenwood single din bluetooth radio. TRD Seat covers and Weathertech/Toyota all weather floor mats. K&N drop in filter.,
,
Primary reason truck is priced as is - drivers door crunched against a concrete parking pylon a few years back. Door has a large dent/crease in it and a slight sag. No cab damage other than some paint rubs.  I tried to show it in picture the best I could. Replace the door and you'd be set. Tires have some life left in them but I'd replace them by winter.,

Selling my 2005 F150 with the offroad FX4 package. I am the 2nd owner and have owned the truck for the last 6+ years. Reason for selling is because I am moving and no longer need the vehicle. Truck runs/drives well and is in good condition. Mainly used for 5 mile daily commute and mountaineering trips on the weekend.,
,
Highlights,
- 4 wheel high/low work as expected,
- brake pads have plenty of life left in them and rotors are in great condition,
- oil changed every 4500 miles, fuel filter every year,
- hard top cover for truck bed included,
- aux port for phones installed and easy to use,
,
Known issues:,
- after about approximately 30-60 min of driving, the overdrive light will begin to blink and a ""Trans Fault"" message will appear on the info screen. This has been occurring for over a year and has never resulted in any driving degradation,
- After the truck has sat for several hours and the weather is cold (normal morning startup conditions), initially shifting from park to drive/1st gear occasionally fails and the truck will go into limp mode. Once the truck is in first, I have not experienced any other issues. This has been occurring for a month.,
- black plastic on radio buttons/transmission shifter have deteriorated,
- window washer fluid spray mechanisms do not work,

        ,
I have a 1987 Porsche 944 in Guards Red for sale.  ,
,
I've owned the car for a little over two years now, purchased in November 2019.  Odometer was broken upon me purchasing it.  Odometer says 196k miles.  I wouldn't have guessed based on how it drives.  ,
,
I've done a ton of work on this car during covid.  Helped keep me busy during lockdown, and genuinely enjoy driving/wrench on this vehicle.  New brakes all around, new radiator, new thermostat, spark plugs, distributor, cap, spark wires, throttle cam, fuel pump, fuel filter, Porsche 944 turbo rear sway bar, RARE late offset 16inch Porsche 944 phone dial wheels and new tires that only have at most 5k miles, only944 LED front headlights, and lots of other little things along the way. ,
,
I took fantastic care of this thing, with oil changes every 3 months regardless of mileage.  I frequently would take this car for long spirited drives all over western Washington.  It drove and handled like a dream.  ,
,
Car was stolen from my home in Queen Anne a month ago.  Seattle police recovered it 5 days after it was stolen. ,
,
The thrives took a sawzall to the ignition lock cylinder and sawed straight through the lock cylinder to turn on the car and drive away.  Besides the fact it will need a new ignition cylinder, the only other damage to the car is some curb rash on one of the wheels (in the pics), and one of the front bumper struts will need to be replaced (in the pics).  The car has NOT been started in about 30 days.  ,
,
Thieves have stolen 2 other cars from my street in the last 30 days since my car was stolen.  Therefore, it's unfortunately not in my best interest to fix it and keep it.  It's just gonna be a sitting duck.  ,
,
I'm not in a rush to sell it, it's happily parked in a safe place for now.  It's a great car, and ready for the next owner to bring it back to it's normal operating condition or maybe take advantage of the situation and make it into an awesome track car.  ,
,
I disassembled the steering wheel/ignition components to see if I could do it myself.  I have all the pieces, but it requires either a tap/die to fully get the ignition lock cylinder off, or you could just take a sawzall and break the rest of it off considering the lock cylinder is already broken.  Either way, I opted not to screw with it and the next owner can make that decision.  A new lock cylinder can be found for like $100-200 online.  ,
,
It's a 35 year old car.  It is not perfect but I daily drove it for years with no issues, and never left me stranded.  Gets compliments everywhere I go. The car does have some paint fade on the roof and driver's door.  I used to keep it waxed and you'd never know.  The interior is alright, not fantastic but cleans up well.  The seats have some splits in the them.  ,
,
$5,000 cash takes it.  I will not show this car unless you have cash in hand.  ,
,
I'm very disappointed to sell this car, lots of fantastic memories driving it and climbing underneath on sunny afternoons to do wrenching.  I have nowhere safe to keep it long-term, my quiet little street in Queen Anne just isn't safe anymore and I'd rather see it go to someone else who can take care of it and have fun with it.  ,
,
I do not need help selling this car.  If the ad is up, it's still for sale.,
,
Comes with tons of other parts, and things that I never got around to doing.  Also includes the original 15 inch phone dials that were on the car when I bought it.

This car has never had an issue. This Subaru has never been to a track and has never been raced. It has maybe been stalled 10 times since owning the vehicle since 2013. And is completely OEM stock.  ,

1972 Chevelle Gen V/6sp auto custom,"$63,000",selah eastside ,https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/cto/d/selah-1972-chevelle-gen-6sp-auto-custom/7445358909.html,"
        ,
1972 Chevelle looking for its forever home. It’s a complete frame off restoration. The car was stripped completely and put on my rotisserie and repaired while the frame and suspension pieces went off to the sand blaster and was powder coated black. When the chassis came back from the powder coater, it received all new bushings, bearings, brakes and HD sway bars. It has front and rear power disk brakes. The 10-bolt rear diff was also powder coated black and now holds a limited slip and 3:73 ring and pinon. I have a 12-bolt diff housing that you’re welcome to if you want it with the car. I had it powder coated to match the chassis.,
Under the hood is a 2017 Silverado Gen 5 5.3 L83 V8. It’s one of the new style GM direct Injected V8 engines. It has a corvette intake manifold to keep the height down and fit under the hood. Stock exhaust manifolds feed dual exhaust.,
I purchased the engine/trans combo from Engine Swap Supply, in Houston Texas. I was told this engine/trans have approx. 10k miles on it when it was removed from a 2017 2wd Silverado. No smoke, no leaks. Runs like a champ!!,
Behind the engine is a six-speed automatic transmission, the 6L80E. Runs and shifts great. I added a new style GM shifter.,
This car has Vintage Air a/c, power steering, all four windows are power up/down, stock interior with all new seats, dash pad, dash assembly, knobs, door panels, and carpet. Before installing the interior, I lined the entire inside of the car with Dynamat Extreme. Floor, sides, doors, roof, you name it, it’s probably covered in Dynamat.,
Retrosound stereo system with custom kick panel speakers, and a custom-built center console for the new style Camaro shifter round out the interior. Monitoring the engine, is a set of Dakota Digital gauges. They interface directly with the OBDII of the engine and can display almost anything you’d like. I have them set to show multiple options, but you can choose almost anything you’d like to monitor on the engine. They even show 0-60 times and ¼ mile times!,
I finished this beautiful car up a few weeks back and have been driving it back and forth to work and around town. So far, I’ve put 250 miles on the odometer with no issues whatsoever. I plan to keep driving it every day till it sells. Only time I won’t be driving it is when the roads freeze up. It’s a lot of fun to drive! I’ve got a full shop of other projects and am looking to sell it to make some room to try to finish them up. Feel free to email/call me with any questions. I also have quite a few pics of the process. Let me know if you’d like to see something specific. Thanks for looking!!

Here is your perfect second car for your new driver or your household. This is my Mother in laws car and sadly she doesn't drive anymore. My in-laws purchased this brand new from Acura of Bellevue and it has been dealer maintained ever since. It has 36,600 miles and no this is not a typo. Timing belt has been replaced per Acura scheduled maintenance, newer tires, newer brakes. Completely original and unmodified. This car needs nothing! It has been garaged its whole life and has never been in an accident. We just had it detailed and is a 9 out of 10. The detailer couldn't believe his eyes. ,
Black exterior/Tan leather interior, 3.2L V6 front wheel drive, automatic, PS,PB,AC. Clean car fax in hand and includes service records. Since this is such a unique situation we are using the Carfax value and this has been confirmed through researching pricing through two of my dealer friends. Please do not quote bluebook values as these do not apply to this car.  We will show car via appointment and only serious inquiries please. You will not be disappointed.,

Extremely RARE 2008 Roush 427R TRAK PAK Mustang #11 of 100,"$24,950","pasco, WA eastside ",https://seattle.craigslist.org/est/ctd/d/pasco-extremely-rare-2008-roush-427r/7444789620.html,"

!).   Jack Roush has achieved tremendous success in various forms of motorsports and equally been successful in aftermarket parts and tuning.   In 2008 Roush offered a unique limited-edition package for the new Ford Mustang GT’s.   For one year only, Roush built just 100 special production 427R Trak Pak Mustangs.   The vehicle we have for is #11 of the 100 units produced.  It is also 1 of 1 in that no other Trak Pak Mustangs were produced with the unique Blue with Red highlight combination.  The car is in excellent condition and shows 81K miles.   The bad news is that the car does have a branded title, however, don’t be concerned.   The car was involved in a minor debris impact along the front lower air dam (photos available).   Damage was minor (intercooler, bumper cover, lower radiator support, however it unfortunately did trigger the driver’s airbag.   No structural or other mechanical damage was done from the otherwise minor incident.   Apparently, due to the airbag deployment the insurance company chose to not repair it and that’s how we acquired the car.   The car was professionally repaired with factory Ford and Roush parts (including all airbag and related safety components) and subsequently fully inspected by the Washington State Patrol.   The car looks and drives amazing and is in very solid mechanical condition.   Since its repair it’s only been used occasionally and displayed in local car shows.,
Roush’s Trak Pak Mustangs were intended to be driven to the racetrack for a day of fun yet be comfortably and reliably driven back home.   #11 was fully optioned (build sheet attached).  Included with the car are instructions tuning its unique suspension as well as other articles, reviews, and information on the TRAK PAK cars.   This car will be a great addition to any Mustang car enthusiast’s collection or for one looking for an affordable but reliable track car.,

Up for sale is a clean 2008 Ford Escape XLT AWD sporting a 2.3 liter 4 cylinder (21 MPG combined), silver exterior with a 2 tone cloth interior. ,
,

,
Car has been recently serviced for oil change, water pump, transmission inspection/flush, valve cover gasket, and camshaft seals. The car was also professional detailed so the next owner will have a clean car without having to worry about the previous owner.,
,
I mention all of the things above as I inspected the car for anything that might need to be replaced or service so the next owner has zero worries purchasing the car. All work has been done by a professional mechanic and the invoice is over $1,000 (saves you money!).,

        ,
Mercedes SL’s are increasingly being sought after and the values continue to rise.  This is a example of the classic pagoda era SL’s.   It has classic Mercedes silver exterior paint with the blue interior.  It has both a hard top and the soft top.  The car is powered by the 4.5L Mercedes V8 with an automatic transmission.  This is not a show car but a decent ”driver quality” car.   The silver paint is fresh but not to a concours level.   The car runs down the road smoothly and comfortably with that expected solid Mercedes feeling.   The odometer shows 53,000 miles, however we are not sure of actual miles as the odometer doesn’t appear to consistently rotate as it should even though the speedometer works just fine.    The car had a WSP inspection after we acquired it.  The tan soft top cloth isn’t perfect and has some wear areas but is usable.  The electric windows work but the edge of one of the side windows shows some minor chips.  Engine runs and fires up right away but may benefit from a fresh tune up and sounds like it might have a small exhaust manifold leak on the passenger side.  Transmission shifts and operates smoothly.  The original radio is still installed and works.    Enjoy it as it is or put a little more TLC into it and have an even nicer car.     Prices continue to climb on these.  Low NADA classic car retail is now over $13K and Average value is over $25K.   This classic Mercedes roadster can be yours $8500.,
